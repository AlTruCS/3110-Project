# 3110-Project
This program allows for the manipulation of student data from a given repository system, using both a Linked List and Binary Search Tree to organize and locate data.

# Functions
At their cores, the Linked List and Binary Search Tree function very similarly in regards to functionality: both structures will use a loop to iterate through themselves, checking each node until one valid for performing the operation has been met. However, the primary difference lies in how the correct node is determined.


## Adding a student to the database

To add a student to the database, the Linked List will create a student object using the data provided by the user and place it at the end of the list. By default, it adds all students from the CSV file to the list.

The Binary Search Tree will instead place the provided existing student object to the right of all values it is larger than, and to the left of all values it is smaller than, with the value coming from inputs in the main function.

## Deleting a student from the database based upon their ID number



## Searching for a student from their ID number

## If name is not avaialble, searching for a student based upon name

## Updating student records when ID number is given; this will also display the student's information and allow any changes except for ID number.
